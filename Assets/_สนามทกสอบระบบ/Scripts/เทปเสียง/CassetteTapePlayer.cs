/// CASSETTE TAPE PLAYER (v1.1) — story tapes for event spots.
///
/// WHAT IT DOES
///   Put this component on an event spot (an empty object, a tape recorder
///   prop, an InteractionPoint — anything). When the PLAYER walks into its
///   trigger collider, a cassette tape recording starts playing FROM THE
///   PLAYER: the sound is 2D, so it is heard at full clarity no matter where
///   the player character is standing or walking while it plays.
///
///   While the tape plays, a "Press [Q] to skip" prompt shows at the middle
///   of the screen, a little below the crosshair — same style and layer as
///   the other prompts in the project (bold white text, black outline,
///   canvas sorting 250, far below the pause menu). Pressing the skip key,
///   or the tape reaching its end, stops the sound and removes the prompt.
///
/// LOUDNESS BOOST (new in v1.1)
///   "Volume" (0–1) mixes the tape as usual. "Loudness Boost" goes FURTHER:
///   it amplifies the recording itself, so the tape can play LOUDER than the
///   original file — a quiet recording no longer needs re-editing:
///     1 = the file's own level (default — behaves exactly like v1.0)
///     2 = twice as loud, 3 = three times, 4 = four times (maximum)
///   The loudest moment of the tape is automatically capped at the clean
///   maximum, so boosting never crackles or distorts. The boost follows the
///   slider LIVE during playback (without losing the playing position), and
///   replays reuse the amplified copy. It needs the clip's Load Type set to
///   "Decompress On Load" (Unity's default for imported audio) — a clip
///   that cannot be amplified simply plays at normal volume and says so
///   once in the Console. The original asset file is never modified.
///
/// ZERO SETUP
///   • Drag ANY audio file Unity imports (.mp3, .ogg, .wav) into the
///     "Tape Clip" field — that is the entire setup.
///   • No trigger collider on the object? A BoxCollider walk-in zone
///     (Center 0,1,0 / Size 2,2,2) is created automatically on Play, exactly
///     like PlayerHitbox's dead zone — add your own trigger collider in edit
///     mode to control the zone and silence the info message.
///   • The skip prompt canvas builds itself from code the first time a tape
///     plays (same conventions as your other HUDs: Screen Space Overlay,
///     sorting 250, 1920x1080 reference scaling). Nothing to wire.
///   • Works on BOTH input backends (legacy Input Manager and the new Input
///     System — keep KeyCodeBridge.cs in the project).
///   • The skip key shares the project's key arbitration (KeyCodeBridge):
///     one press performs one action, even if other systems listen to Q.
///
/// TRIGGER MODES
///   OnPlayerEnter — the tape starts the moment the player walks in (default).
///   ManualOnly   — this script never starts the tape by itself. Call
///                  PlayTape() from any UnityEvent (an InteractionPoint's
///                  activation event, a UI button, another script...) — the
///                  public API is listed below.
///
/// RULES IT FOLLOWS
///   • Only ONE tape plays at a time: a new tape starting stops the previous
///     one (the previous tape's prompt disappears with it).
///   • Walking into the SAME spot again while its tape is already playing
///     does not restart it; after it ended, walking in again replays it
///     (turn "Replay On Re-enter" off to make a tape play only once).
///   • The tape keeps playing while the player walks anywhere (2D audio) —
///     it only stops on SKIP, on reaching its end, when this component is
///     disabled/destroyed, or when the pause menu is open (it freezes with
///     the rest of the game and resumes after unpausing — same behaviour as
///     every other gameplay system here).
///   • Keep this component on an object that stays ACTIVE during playback
///     (an own empty "Event Spot" object is perfect): when its object turns
///     off, the tape and the prompt stop with it.
