/// <summary>
/// Aims the player's flashlight (a Spot Light) wherever the camera is looking —
/// like pointing a gun in a third-person shooter.
///
/// Attach this component to the Spot Light GameObject that is tagged
/// "Flashlight". The light can be parented ANYWHERE (the player's body, the
/// camera, a hand bone …): this script drives the light's world rotation so it
/// always matches the camera's view direction, no matter how it is attached.
///
/// Completely independent from the enemy scripts — this component never
/// references any enemy code. The enemies find this light by its "Flashlight"
/// tag instead (see FlashlightDetector), so you can add, move or remove this
/// component freely without touching the enemy prefab.
///
/// The toggle key works on BOTH input backends (legacy Input Manager and the
/// new Input System) — keep KeyCodeBridge.cs in the project for the latter.
///
/// v1.2 – frozen while the pause menu is open (GamePauseManager): the aim
///        locks and the toggle key is ignored until the game is resumed.
///
/// v2.0 – BATTERY SYSTEM:
///        The flashlight now has a battery that drains while the light is on.
///        A green bar with a white frame appears in the BOTTOM-RIGHT corner of
///        the screen (FlashlightBatteryHUD.cs — keep that file in the project
///        too; the bar builds itself, no scene setup needed).
///        - The bar shrinks toward the right side as power is used.
///        - When the battery runs out, the light in the player's hand TURNS
///          OFF by itself and pressing F only produces a weak dying sputter.
///        - The light flickers when the battery gets low.
///        - Call RechargeBattery() / RechargeBatteryFull() from a pickup item
///          to refill it (also available as Context Menu test actions).
///        - Events: On Battery Low / On Battery Empty (hook sounds here).
///        Turn "Use Battery" off to get the old unlimited-light behaviour.
///
/// v2.1 – EDITOR-EDITABLE BATTERY UI (user request: "I want to move and scale
///        the battery UI without touching code"): right-click this
///        component's header in the Inspector and pick
///        "Battery: Create Editable HUD In Scene (editor)" — the battery bar
///        becomes a permanent scene object you can MOVE / RESIZE / SCALE with
///        the normal Scene view tools, and the layout is saved with the
///        scene. At Play a HUD that already exists in the scene is reused
///        automatically (never duplicated). All battery values (duration,
///        start charge, low threshold, flicker …) are Inspector fields.
///
/// v2.2 – CHARACTER ANIMATION SUPPORT, ZERO SETUP, ZERO WARNINGS.
///        Replaces the version that printed
///        "Character Animator is not assigned. Assign the character's
///        Animator in the Inspector." every time the game started.
///        - The Animator is found AUTOMATICALLY (no Inspector assignment
///          needed): first on the flashlight's parents (the usual setup —
///          the flashlight sits inside the character model), then anywhere
///          in the player hierarchy.
///        - NO WARNINGS, EVER. A missing Animator or missing parameters are
///          a normal, supported state: the flashlight (aim, toggle, battery,
///          HUD) works exactly the same with or without animations. When no
///          Animator exists you get ONE white info hint in the editor —
///          never a yellow warning, never spam, nothing in builds.
///        - HOW ANIMATIONS ARE DRIVEN (ask your animator to add ONE of
///          these to the character's Animator Controller — the names are
///          also editable fields in the Inspector):
///            • a BOOL parameter named "FlashlightOn" (true = light on,
///              false = light off) — recommended, mirrors the light state,
///              survives re-entrance and scene changes; or
///            • TRIGGER parameters "FlashlightOn" / "FlashlightOff" — fired
///              on each switch (used only when the bool does not exist).
///          Parameters that don't exist are simply not driven — no setup is
///          wrong, nothing can break. Right-click the component header and
///          pick "Animation: Show Detected Animator & Parameters" to see
///          exactly what was found.
///        - New events On Turned On / On Turned Off (hook click sounds).
///        - SetOn() is now idempotent (switching to the state it already has
///          does not replay the animation).
///
/// v2.3 – UNITY 6.6 FIX: "Animator is not playing an AnimatorController".
///        When the character model carries an Animator component WITHOUT an
///        Animator Controller assigned (a half-integrated model import — WIP
///        hand-me-downs from an animator friend look exactly like this),
///        v2.2's parameter scan still read that Animator, and Unity logged
///        "Animator is not playing an AnimatorController" (error + warning)
///        from FlashlightController.Awake every run. v2.3 treats a
///        controller-less Animator as "no animations": the parameter scan and
///        every Set/SetTrigger are skipped cleanly — ONE white editor info
///        hint explains the fix (assign the controller, or remove the
///        Animator). The moment a controller IS assigned — even mid-Play —
///        the next flashlight toggle picks the animations up automatically.
///        The right-click "Animation: Show Detected Animator & Parameters"
///        action now reports the missing-controller case explicitly.
